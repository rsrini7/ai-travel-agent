# AI-Powered Travel Agent Automation
Welcome to the AI-Powered Travel Agent Automation project! This project is a Streamlit application designed to automate the process of travel agent tasks, including managing travel enquiries, generating itinerary suggestions, inputting vendor replies, and generating professional-looking quotations in PDF and DOCX formats. The system leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for content generation and Supabase for backend data storage and file management.

## 🚀 Overview

This project is a **AI Travel Agent** demonstrating an AI-powered travel automation system. It allows users to manage travel enquiries, generate itinerary suggestions, input vendor replies, and automatically create professional-looking quotations in PDF and DOCX formats. The system leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for content generation and Supabase for backend data storage and file management.

## ⚙️ Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11
- A Supabase account (for database and storage)
- API Keys:
  - Google API Key (if using Gemini)
  - OpenRouter API Key (if using OpenRouter)

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```
2. **Create a Virtual Environment and Activate it:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   # On Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   # On macOS/Linux
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Set up Environment Variables:**
   - Copy `.env.example` to a new file named `.env`:
     ```bash
     cp .env.example .env
     ```
   - Edit `.env` and fill in your actual credentials:
     ```env
     SUPABASE_URL="YOUR_SUPABASE_URL"
     SUPABASE_KEY="YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY" # Or service_role key if needed for specific policies
     GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY"
     OPENROUTER_API_KEY="YOUR_OPENROUTER_API_KEY"
     OPENROUTER_DEFAULT_MODEL="google/gemini-flash-1.5" # Example, can be overridden
     OPENROUTER_HTTP_REFERER="http://localhost:3000" # Optional, set your app's URL
     OPENROUTER_APP_TITLE="AI Travel Quotation" # Optional, set your app's title
     ```
5. **Supabase Setup:**
   - Go to your Supabase project dashboard.
   - **Database:**
     - Navigate to the "SQL Editor".
     - Click "+ New query" and run the contents of `schema.sql` to create the necessary tables.
     - (For development/reset, you can use `schema-drop.sql` to remove tables.)
   - **Storage:**
     - Navigate to "Storage".
     - Click "Create a new bucket".
     - Name the bucket `quotations`. Make it a public bucket if you want direct public URLs, or keep it private and rely on signed URLs (the app handles both).
     - Go back to the "SQL Editor" and run the contents of `storage.sql` to set up access policies for the `quotations` bucket. This allows anonymous uploads and reads as configured in the file.
6. **Prepare Assets (for PDF Generation):**
   - The PDF generation uses custom fonts and images.
   - The DejaVu fonts are included in `assets/fonts/`.
   - You need to provide the following image files in the `assets/` directory:
     - `assets/top_banner.png` (a banner image for the top of the PDF)
     - `assets/tripexplore-logo-with-rating.png` (a logo image)
   - If these images are not present, the PDF generation will print warnings and skip them.

## ▶️ Running the Application

Once the setup is complete, run the Streamlit application:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The application will open in your web browser, typically at [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501).

---

## 📖 Usage

The application is organized into three main tabs:

1. **📝 New Enquiry:**
   - Fill in the travel details (Destination, Number of Days, Travelers, Trip Type).
   - Provide client information (Name, Mobile, City, Email).
   - Click "Submit Enquiry" to save the information to Supabase.
2. **🔍 Manage Enquiries & Itinerary:**
   - Select an existing enquiry from the dropdown list.
   - View the details of the selected enquiry.
   - If an AI-generated itinerary already exists, it will be displayed.
   - Click "Generate Places Suggestions" to use an LLM (selected via the sidebar AI Configuration) to suggest places/attractions for the trip. The suggestions will be saved.
3. **✍️ Add Vendor Reply & Generate Quotation:**
   - Select an enquiry. Its details and any existing itinerary/vendor reply will be loaded.
   - **Add/View Vendor Reply:**
     - Input or update the vendor's reply, including details like pricing, inclusions, exclusions, hotel information, etc.
     - Click "Submit/Update Vendor Reply" to save it.
   - **AI Quotation Generation:**
     - Ensure a vendor reply is available.
     - The system uses the enquiry details, AI-generated itinerary (from Tab 2 or database), and the vendor reply to generate a quotation.
     - Click "Generate Quotation PDF" to:
       1. Use an LLM to structure all information into a JSON.
       2. Generate a PDF document from this JSON.
       3. Upload the PDF to Supabase Storage.
       4. Save the quotation metadata (including the JSON and storage path) to the database.
     - Click "Generate Quotation DOCX" to:
       1. Perform the same LLM structuring and PDF generation as above.
       2. Convert the generated PDF bytes into DOCX format.
       3. Upload the DOCX to Supabase Storage.
       4. Update the quotation record in the database with the DOCX storage path.
   - **Download/View Quotation Files:**
     - Links to download/view stored PDF and DOCX files from Supabase Storage will appear (public or signed URLs).
     - Buttons to download locally generated PDF/DOCX files (from the current session before potential re-runs or selection changes) will also be available.

### Global AI Configuration (Sidebar)

- Use the sidebar to select the AI Provider (Gemini or OpenRouter) that will be used for all LLM tasks (itinerary suggestions, quotation structuring).
- The currently active provider and model (for OpenRouter) are displayed.

## 📊 Supabase Schema

The application uses the following tables in Supabase:

- `enquiries`: Stores initial customer travel enquiries.
- `clients`: Stores client/customer information linked to enquiries.
- `itineraries`: Stores AI-generated itineraries/place suggestions for enquiries.
- `vendor_replies`: Stores vendor replies (pricing, terms) related to an enquiry.
- `quotations`: Stores final generated quotations, including the structured JSON data, links to PDF/DOCX files in Supabase Storage, and references to the itinerary/vendor reply versions used.

Refer to `schema.sql` for detailed table definitions and relationships.

## 💡 Future Development Ideas

- More sophisticated AI prompting for itineraries and quotations.
- User authentication and roles.
- Direct email integration for sending quotations.
- Advanced quotation template customization.
- Status tracking for enquiries (e.g., 'New', 'Itinerary Generated', 'Quotation Sent').
- Image integration within the PDF itinerary (e.g., destination photos).
