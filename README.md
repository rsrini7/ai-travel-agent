# AI-Powered End-to-End Travel Automation System (MVP)

This project is a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for an AI-powered system designed to automate various aspects of travel business operations, focusing on enquiry intake, itinerary research, and quotation generation.

**Live Demo:** [Link to your Streamlit Cloud deployment if you have one]
**GitHub Repository:** [https://github.com/rsrini7/ai-travel-agent](https://github.com/rsrini7/ai-travel-agent)

## Overview

The system aims to streamline the process for travel agents by:
1.  Accepting customer travel enquiries.
2.  Utilizing AI (Large Language Models) to research and generate draft itineraries.
3.  Processing vendor replies (e.g., pricing, inclusions).
4.  Generating formatted quotations for customers by combining itinerary and vendor information with AI assistance.

This MVP demonstrates the core workflow using Python, Streamlit for the UI, Langchain & LangGraph for AI orchestration, and Supabase as the backend database.

## Features (MVP)

*   **Enquiry Intake:**
    *   Web form to capture customer travel details (destination, dates, travelers, trip type).
    *   Enquiries are stored in a Supabase database.
*   **AI Itinerary Generation:**
    *   Generate a day-wise itinerary based on enquiry details using a Large Language Model (currently configured for Google Gemini 1.5 Flash).
    *   Generated itineraries are stored and linked to the original enquiry.
*   **Vendor Reply Intake:**
    *   Interface to input plain text vendor replies (containing pricing, inclusions/exclusions).
    *   Vendor replies are stored and linked to the relevant enquiry.
*   **AI-Powered Quotation Generation:**
    *   Combines the AI-generated itinerary and parsed vendor reply information using LangGraph and an LLM.
    *   Outputs a structured quotation draft.
    *   Quotations are stored and linked to the enquiry.
*   **Basic Management UI:**
    *   View lists of enquiries.
    *   Select an enquiry to view its details, generated itinerary, vendor reply, and quotation.
    *   Trigger generation steps for selected enquiries.

## Technology Stack

*   **Backend:** Python
*   **Frontend/UI:** Streamlit
*   **AI Orchestration:** Langchain, LangGraph
*   **Large Language Model (LLM):** Google Gemini 1.5 Flash (configurable)
*   **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL)
*   **Environment Management:** `python-dotenv`

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.10+
*   Supabase Account: [https://supabase.com/](https://supabase.com/)
*   Google Cloud Project with Generative Language API (Gemini API) enabled.
    *   Obtain a Google API Key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) or your Google Cloud Console.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rsrini7/ai-travel-agent.git
cd ai-travel-agent
```

### 2. Set up Supabase

1.  Create a new project in Supabase.
2.  **Enable `uuid-ossp` Extension:**
    *   In your Supabase project dashboard, go to `Database` -> `Extensions`.
    *   Search for `uuid-ossp` and enable it.
3.  **Create Tables:**
    *   Go to `SQL Editor` in your Supabase dashboard.
    *   Run the SQL commands provided in the [Database Schema](#database-schema) section below (or use the SQL provided earlier in project discussions if available separately).
4.  **Configure Row Level Security (RLS):**
    *   For MVP/development, you can temporarily disable RLS for the created tables or create permissive policies.
    *   Example (run in SQL Editor for each table, e.g., `public.enquiries`):
        ```sql
        ALTER TABLE public.enquiries ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
        CREATE POLICY "Public anon access"
        ON public.enquiries
        FOR ALL
        TO anon
        USING (true)
        WITH CHECK (true);
        ```
        Repeat for `itineraries`, `vendor_replies`, and `quotations` tables.
        **Caution:** For production, implement stricter RLS policies.

### 3. Set up Environment Variables

1.  Create a `.env` file in the root of the project directory:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
2.  Edit the `.env` file with your credentials:
    ```
    SUPABASE_URL="YOUR_SUPABASE_URL"
    SUPABASE_KEY="YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY" # Or your service_role key if needed for specific policies
    GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY"
    ```
    *   Find `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_KEY` (anon key) in your Supabase project settings under `API`.

### 4. Create a Virtual Environment and Install Dependencies

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Run the Application

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
The application should open in your web browser, typically at `http://localhost:8501`.

## Usage Flow

1.  **Submit New Enquiry:** Go to the "üìù New Enquiry" tab and fill in the travel details.
2.  **Manage Enquiries & Generate:**
    *   Go to the "üîç Manage Enquiries & Generate" tab.
